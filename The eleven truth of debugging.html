ntuition and hunches are great—you just have to test them out. When a hunch
and a fact collide, the fact wins.
2. Don’t look for complex explanations. Even the simplest omission or typo can
lead to very weird behavior. Everyone is capable of producing extremely simple and
obvious errors from time to time. Look at code critically—don’t just sweep your eye
over that series of simple statements assuming that they are too simple to be wrong.
3. The clue to what is wrong in your code is in the values of your variables and the
flow of control. Try to see what the facts are pointing to. The computer is not trying
to mislead you. Work from the facts.
4. Be systematic. Be persistent. Don’t panic. The bug is not moving around in
your code, trying to trick or evade you. It is just sitting in one place, doing the wrong
thing in the same way every time.
5. If you code was working a minute ago, but now it doesn’t—what was the last
thing you changed? This incredibly reliable rule of thumb is the reason your section
leader told you to test your code as you go rather than all at once.
6. Do not change your code haphazardly trying to track down a bug. This is sort of
like a scientist who changes more than one variable at a time. It makes the observed
behavior much more difficult to interpret, and you tend to introduce new bugs.
7. If you find some wrong code which does not seem to be related to the bug you
were tracking, fix the wrong code anyway. Many times the wrong code was related to
or obscured the bug in a way you had not imagined.
8. You should be able to explain in Sherlock Holmes style the series of facts, tests,
and deductions which led you to find a bug. Alternately, if you have a bug but can’t
pinpoint it, then you should be able to give an argument to a critical third party
detailing why each one of your procedures cannot contain the bug. One of these
arguments will contain a flaw since one of your procedures does in fact contain a bug.
Trying to construct the arguments may help you to see the flaw.
9. Be critical of your beliefs about your code. It’s almost impossible to see a bug in
a procedure when your instinct is that the procedure is innocent. In that case, only
when the facts have proven without question that the procedure is the source of the
problem will you be able to see the bug.
10. You need to be systematic, but there is still an enormous amount of room for
beliefs, hunches, guesses, etc. Use your intuition about where the bug probably is to
direct the order that you check things in your systematic search. Check the procedures
you suspect the most first. Good instincts will come with experience.
11. Debugging depends on an objective and reasoned approach. It depends on
overall perspective and understanding of the workings of your code. Debugging code
is more mentally demanding than writing code. The longer you try to track down a
bug without success, the less perspective you tend to have. Realize when you have
lost the perspective on your code to debug. Take a break. Get some sleep. You
cannot debug when you are not seeing things clearly. Many times a programmer can
spend hours late at night hunting for a bug only to finally give up at 4:00 A.M. The
next day, they find the bug in 10 minutes. What allowed them to find the bug the next
day so quickly? Maybe they just needed some sleep and time for perspective. Or
maybe their subconscious figured it out while they were asleep. In any case, the “go
do something else for a while, come back, and find the bug immediately” scenario
happens too often to be an accident.
